ar-tabletop
===========

Interactive virtual tabletop using augmented reality.

Building
--------

The following dependencies are required for building:

 - ArUco (and hence OpenCV)
 - Boost (I think? Should probably double check that...)
 - GLUT
 - Qt5
 - gtest

Once you have these dependencies you can build by simply running 'make'.
